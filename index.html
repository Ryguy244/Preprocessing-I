            <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
              <p>I am Arthur, King of the Britons. Perhaps you have heard of me. My father was Uther Pendragon, King before me. I have come to you, dear squire, because I have heard that you are worthy of joining me in my court at Camelot. Will you swear fealty to me, here and now?</p>

        <p>Heavy is the head that wears the crown. And my head is certainly heavy. Heavy with the weight of the literal blessing of God, a magnetic charisma that pulls the most exceptional knights in England towards me, and the knowledge that, even as I write this, I am hurtling towards my goal of finding the Holy Grail. </p>
